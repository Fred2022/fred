what else?
Another tjih that excitd me are weekends , ill get to go home and see my dad and mom. Spend nice time, eat good food and all, but still something always feel off anytime I go home for weekends, it does nor judt lok like what IT USED TO BE , FOR SOME REASON I DO NOT KNOW PARTICUlarly, I camt say whether positive or negative
I can still remember the rush on mondays, dad has to go to work early and also drop us off inn school before we return to mahin mis place for the rest of the week.
It is uasally cold, dark and most times I feel too weak to carry anything , I hate bathing
QUESTIONS.
When did godwin came to join me in grandmas place



It was a sunny day, hot, the sky was not smiling, the grasses had been drained of the dews and people had started returning from work, so did my friends and I.
The memory is blurred, I cannot recollect how many we were on the street that day, and neither can I recollect their names. 
Coming from school, dehydrated, we passed through  the dusty road which is most trodden by average part of the student that attended my primary school , with the name agunpopo nursery and primary school, the road are for us which enters through the small  red colored gate.
 We were joking, laughing and then B said, “We have a gate in our house, and we use pumping machine” her lip tightened but filled with humor
“We also have, in fact my dad bought a new TV set” A replied, with all her teeth out
“emm, really?” I pretended to be interested; it was almost a blank look.
“Yes, in fact we use water closet” A answered, looking into my eyes like one expecting a big shot from me.
I smiled.
We turned left, it was the road that led to our house, as we turned left the second time ,I saw the picture of our house for what it was, it was not plastered ,so small and has rust steels as roof, had a traditional cooking stones outside, three stones set in way to accommodate any pot, the bathroom was outside, it’s a kind with a stick as a door which you are to decide whether to protect yourself with clothe or not. 
For some micro seconds my heart stopped and I didn’t know whether to stop at our cubicle and tell my friends this is where I live, or just branch a street close by and say I’d like to get something. But then since I had no choice, the place is meant to be our house. I went for the former and besides maihin mi is sited at the edge of the passage , eulogizing  and the aroma of her stew is so tantalizing and welcoming that I could not resist the urge to say ” meet my mum” to my friends.
They stayed for some time, while maihin mi asked them questions like “whose kid are you?”.You know all those stuffs.
she gave them bread and fetch them a cold water from her old clay pot, they left joyously and I walked them a little.
I came in to free myself of the sweat wrecked purple uniform, I took my rice and ate to satisfaction, while maihin mi kept singing her old Christian song in the corridor, and intermittently she’d say “oyekemi, when you are done , make sure you fetch water”  then name all other chores I am expected to sort, and before I am done with the food, my head is already crowded with load of works I am expected to do.
When I was done , I took my chance and ask her “ maihin mi, why can’t we go and rent another house?, this place is not fine”
She raised her wide curved brow and brown eyes and just puffed her cheek bones, I can still remember the look on her face, it told me a lot than she said , “ go and fetch the water” she told me
I left and was displeased that she’s not going to say a word to me, the thought lingered in my heart throughout the evening that I slept on it.
 DAD VISITS.
“good day here o” it was a thick masculine voice, he laughed loudly
“okomi, ajamu , how is everything, thank you for always” I reckoned that was maihin mi’s voice 
I shifted on the big bed I squawk on, opened one eye briefly  “ajogbe, wake up and greet your dad” maihin mi’s voice came penetrating my peaceful sleep, I knew they were coming because they nearly missed any evening to check up on  us, my parents.
And your guess is as good as mine , it took me a couple of minute to spiral out of that foamy bed,.
I came out to the corridor, eyes puffed and all , knelt down and greeted him as he showered me with precious blessings, any time I hear his voice., I am always excited that there is someone who lives  in a better place than we do that is always coming to check up on us plus he seems close and will always leave me a token before living.
And as expected, I’d hear a feminine voice coming faintly from outside, in the midst of bike horn and car hums, our house was facing the street.  “ yes sir, how is everybody/ and my husbands?, yes o, we thank God, Ay. How are you?  Bawo ni studies ? well-done o” it was a calming, sonorous, joyous voice, that’s my mum, someone said I took after her when it comes to voice.
And then, after a couple of minute dad has entered, she’ll step in, kneel down in front of mahin mi “ good evening maami” her face all down, using one hand to hold her hand bag while my fishing eyes has omnisciently searched through it in the mind of my heart, to see if there is any goody-goody for me.
“okomi ajoke, good evening, God bless you and the work of your hands, satan will not have upper hand in your life , you will always enjoy your marriage….”while mahin mi continues with her blessings, which almost sounds like recitation to me, I’d start moving gently to collect the bag and do justice to whatever is inside.
“Amen “ my mum would echo, with a gentle sigh punctuating whatever spiraled through her mind, and then she’d look at me and repeat what mahin mi had done to her, by then I’d have either a stick of corn or biscuit in my mouth, munching and saying amen.

These two can comes during the week just to visit and on weekends they come to take me with them, it was on a weekend.<br /><br />
